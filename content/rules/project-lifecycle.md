# Project Lifecycle & Authority Model

## 0.1 Projects Are Earned, Not Claimed

In Praxis, a project does not start with code. It starts with an idea that survives criticism.

- Creating a project idea does not grant permanent ownership, authority, or control.
- Authority is earned continuously through responsibility and contribution.
- Praxis treats every project as a product candidate, not a personal experiment.

## 0.2 The Praxis Project Lifecycle

Every project in the club follows a defined lifecycle. Skipping steps or bypassing this process is not allowed.

### Phase 1 — Idea & Initial Research

A project begins with:

- A clear problem statement
- Initial research (market, users, existing solutions, constraints)
- A proposed technical direction

At this stage:

- No team is formed
- No authority exists yet
- The idea is challenged, not supported by default

_The goal is not approval — the goal is pressure-testing the idea._

### Phase 2 — Pitch & Critical Review (VC Simulation)

The project creator must present the idea to club staff and reviewers, in a format similar to an investor pitch.

**You should expect:**

- Hard questions
- Feasibility challenges
- Technical criticism
- Requests for proof, scope reduction, or redesign

**You are expected to:**

- Defend your decisions
- Accept valid criticism
- Iterate on the idea if needed

**Approval is based on:**

- Clarity of problem
- Seriousness of execution
- Realistic scope
- The creator's ability to lead responsibly

Rejected projects may be resubmitted after improvement.

### Phase 3 — Team Formation (Recruitment Comes First)

Once approved, the first real phase of a project is recruitment, not development.

The project lead must:

- Define roles needed (dev, PM, design, etc.)
- Open applications or invite candidates
- Review candidates via:
  - Resume card
  - Short interview
  - Past contribution history

_Joining a project is not automatic. Every team member is accepted based on expected contribution and responsibility._

### Phase 4 — Research & Planning

After team formation:

- Deeper technical research begins
- Architecture decisions are proposed and reviewed
- Scope is refined
- MVP goals are clearly defined

No heavy implementation should start before this phase is validated.

### Phase 5 — MVP Execution

The team works toward a functional MVP:

- Tasks are assigned
- Contributions are tracked
- Reviews are mandatory
- Deadlines exist

_This phase determines whether the project is viable or not._

### Phase 6 — Production / Scaling / Archival

Based on results:

- The project may move toward production
- Be iterated further
- Or be archived if it fails to meet expectations

_Archiving a project is not a failure — it is a valid outcome._

## 0.3 Leadership Does Not Mean Ownership

Creating a project does not mean:

- You own other people's work
- You control the project regardless of contribution
- Your role is guaranteed forever

The Project Lead role exists only while:

- You actively contribute
- You fulfill leadership responsibilities
- Your contribution justifies your authority

If a Project Lead's contribution drops below acceptable levels:

- Leadership can be revoked
- The role may be reassigned
- The original creator may be downgraded to a contributor role

**Leadership is performance-based, not symbolic.**

## 0.4 Contribution Is Mandatory for Everyone

Praxis does not allow passive membership inside projects.

- If you are a Project Lead and do not contribute → leadership is removed
- If you are a team member and do not contribute → you are removed from the project

Contribution thresholds and evaluation rules are defined in the Contribution System section.

**No role is immune.**

## 0.5 Removal, Demotion, and Project Survival

To protect projects:

- Roles can be changed based on contribution and reliability
- Members can be removed for inactivity or repeated failure
- Projects can continue without their original creator

**The project's survival is more important than individual attachment.**

## 0.6 Leadership Is Conditional and Continuously Evaluated

Holding a leadership role in Praxis is conditional, not permanent.

Leadership exists only while:

- Responsibilities are fulfilled
- Contribution remains above minimum thresholds
- The team environment remains healthy

There are two independent mechanisms that can result in leadership removal:

- Automatic system-based demotion
- Human-triggered review and decision

**Both are legitimate. Neither is personal.**

## 0.7 Automatic Leadership Demotion (System-Enforced)

Praxis enforces minimum leadership activity requirements.

A Project Lead is automatically demoted to a regular contributor if:

No meaningful contribution is recorded for two consecutive weeks, including:

- No task progress
- No accepted contributions
- No meeting attendance
- No leadership actions (planning, reviews, coordination)

This demotion:

- Requires no discussion
- Requires no vote
- Is applied uniformly to all leads

**The goal is to protect the project from stagnation, not to punish individuals.**

## 0.8 Temporary Leadership Reassignment

When automatic demotion occurs:

- The team member with the highest recent contribution and performance is assigned as temporary Project Lead
- This assignment remains until:
  - The new lead accepts the role formally
  - Or declines it, in which case the role is reassigned

Temporary leadership ensures:

- Project continuity
- No leadership vacuum
- No emotional debates during critical phases

Final leadership confirmation may involve staff review if needed.

## 0.9 Human-Triggered Leadership Review (Team Escalation)

**Technical contribution alone is not sufficient to justify leadership.**

If a Project Lead:

- Is disrespectful or toxic
- Fails to communicate
- Neglects leadership responsibilities (planning, coordination, reviews)
- Creates a harmful team environment

Then team members may request a leadership review.

**Review Process:**

1. Team members report concerns to club staff
2. Staff initiates an examination:
   - Review contribution logs
   - Review task assignments and follow-up
   - Review communication and conduct
3. A discussion is held with the lead
4. A decision is made:
   - Maintain role
   - Put on probation
   - Demote from leadership

This process is documented for transparency.

## 0.10 Leadership Demotion Is Not Removal From the Project

Leadership removal:

- Does not remove the person from the project
- Does not erase past contributions
- Does not imply personal failure

**It is a role correction, not a punishment.**

Continued contribution can allow re-earning leadership in the future.
