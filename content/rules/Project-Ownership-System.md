Perfect — then we can focus **only on the ownership & evaluation section**. I’ll create a **clear, structured Markdown** explaining:

- Difference between public vs private projects
- How contributions are evaluated
- Ownership thresholds and calculation
- Leadership and influence rules
- Goals for students (experience, portfolio, real stakes)

Here’s a draft you can directly drop into your Markdown file:

# Ownership & Evaluation of Projects

## 1. Public vs Private Projects

### Public Projects

- Private repo but **visible to all Praxis members**.
- Anyone can join, contribute, and take tasks.
- **No ownership exists**: XP reflects effort and contribution, not equity.
- Goal: **experience, skill development, portfolio building, and career opportunities**.
- High contributors are more likely to be invited to continue projects externally (internships, jobs, collaborations).

### Private Projects

- Only **team members** have access to the code.
- Staff can monitor progress, audits, and milestones.
- Ownership is **earned via contribution points**:

  - Minimum contribution = **75% of project average XP** to be eligible.
  - Ownership is proportional to XP above this threshold.

- Goal: **simulate real startup equity, teach responsibility, and reward real effort**.

## 2. Contribution Evaluation

- All tasks are assigned **size-based XP** (`S | M | L | XL`).

- XP is augmented by additional work:

  - Research & documentation
  - Explaining tasks/research to team or club
  - Mentoring, reviewing, QA, DevOps improvements
  - Attending or leading meetings
  - Task creation (for PM/PL)

- **Audits**:

  - Staff randomly checks tasks for completion and accuracy.
  - AI-assisted task size estimation ensures fair XP.
  - Inflated or fake tasks are penalized:

    - Minor → XP reduction
    - Moderate → XP loss + warning
    - Severe → Role demotion or removal

## 3. Ownership Calculation (Private Projects)

1. Identify **eligible members**: XP ≥ 75% of project average.
2. Calculate **total eligible XP**.
3. Assign ownership proportionally:

```text
Ownership % = (Member XP / Total Eligible XP) * 100
```

**Example:**

| Member | XP  | Eligible? |
| ------ | --- | --------- |
| Alice  | 150 | Yes       |
| Bob    | 90  | Yes       |
| Carol  | 60  | No        |

- Recalculated at **milestones or checkpoints**.
- Staff audits ensure **fairness and integrity**.

---

## 4. Leadership & Influence

- Leadership requires **active contribution**, mentorship, and guidance.
- Automatic downgrade: failure to contribute for 2 checkpoints → role removed.
- Team veto: members can request review if a leader is inactive, disrespectful, or failing duties.
- High contributors (>40% of total work) can **propose leadership or position**, but require **team/staff approval**.

---

## 5. Goals for Students

- Learn **real project workflows**, from idea → research → MVP → production.
- Understand **responsibility and accountability** in a team.
- Gain **experience and XP that reflects real work**.
- Prepare for **career opportunities or startup participation**.
- Experience **ownership and influence proportional to contribution** (private projects only).
