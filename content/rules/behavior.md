# Behavior, Accountability, and Professional Conduct

## 1.1 Behavior Is a System Constraint, Not a Moral Code

Behavior rules in Praxis are **not about being nice** and **not about personality**.

They exist to:

- Protect project execution
- Preserve trust between contributors
- Prevent hidden failure modes (silence, ego, sabotage)

If behavior damages delivery, learning, or team stability, it is a **system problem**, not a personal preference.

## 1.2 Respect Does Not Mean Agreement

In Praxis:

- You are allowed to disagree
- You are expected to challenge ideas
- You are encouraged to question decisions

However:

- Once a decision is made and documented, undermining it is not acceptable
- Passive resistance (“I don’t agree so I won’t help”) is treated as misconduct

Respect means **professional execution**, not emotional alignment.

---

## 1.3 Criticism Is Mandatory and Expected

Praxis operates on review and critique.

You must expect:

- Your code to be reviewed
- Your ideas to be challenged
- Your decisions to be questioned

You are expected to:

- Defend your work with reasoning
- Accept valid criticism
- Improve based on feedback

Criticism must always target:

- Code
- Architecture
- Decisions
- Process

Never the person.

## 1.4 Authority Never Overrides Behavior Rules

Behavior rules apply **equally** to:

- Project Leads
- Tech Leads
- PMs
- Senior contributors
- Staff members

Holding authority does **not** grant permission to:

- Disrespect others
- Ignore feedback
- Bypass process
- Create fear-based leadership

Abuse of authority is treated as a **severe violation**, with stricter consequences than normal misconduct.

---

## 1.5 Reliability Is a Behavioral Requirement

Reliability is not optional.

This includes:

- Completing accepted tasks
- Communicating early when blocked
- Attending required meetings or notifying absence
- Handing off work properly if unable to continue

Repeated unreliability is treated as:

- A behavior issue
- A role mismatch
- Grounds for demotion or removal

Skill does not compensate for unreliability.

---

## 1.6 Transparency Over Silence

Silence is more harmful than mistakes.

Praxis expects:

- Clear communication of progress
- Early reporting of blockers
- Documented decisions
- Visible task ownership

Uncommunicated absence, hidden blockers, or silent disagreement are considered **project risks**.

---

## 1.7 No Political or Ego-Driven Behavior

Praxis is not a social hierarchy.

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- Forming alliances to influence decisions
- Undermining leads indirectly
- Using contribution scores as social weapons
- Blocking progress for personal recognition
- Performing work only to inflate points

Contribution must serve the project, not personal image.

---

## 1.8 Feedback and Complaints Follow Defined Channels

If a problem exists:

- Use the defined escalation path
- Contact staff or reviewers
- Provide evidence, not emotions

Public accusations, gossip, or pressure campaigns are unacceptable.

This protects both:

- Contributors from abuse
- Leads from mob behavior

---

## 1.9 Behavioral Violations Have Consequences

Behavioral violations may result in:

- Warnings
- Role demotion
- Temporary suspension from projects
- Permanent removal in severe cases

Consequences are proportional, documented, and role-aware.
